Jet Compose sample tutorial code mentioned in : https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial

1. Lession : Composable Function : Jetpack Compose is built around composable functions. 
These functions let you define your app's UI programmatically by describing how it should look and providing data dependencies,
rather than focusing on the process of the UI's construction (initializing an element, attaching it to a parent, etc.).  
To create a composable function, just add the @Composable annotation to the function name.
 
2. Lession : Layout : UI elements are hierarchical, with elements contained in other elements. 
In Compose, you build a UI hierarchy by calling composable functions from other composable functions.
